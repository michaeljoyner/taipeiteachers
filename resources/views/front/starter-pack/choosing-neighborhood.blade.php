        <h1 class="text-4xl mb-16 max-w-lg mx-auto text-site-secondary font-cursive">Choosing your neighborhood</h1>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">Nowhere is very far from anywhere in Taipei. With the MRT you can get anywhere in the city relatively quickly. But to help you choose where you might want to live, here’s a quick breakdown of some of the more popular neighborhoods (amongst expats) to live in.</p>
        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">Xinyi</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Red/Blue</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>High</p>
            <p class="my-6">Xinyi is home to the iconic Taipei 101 building and marked by fine dining and luxury shopping. It also has the some of Taipei’s best nightlife with most of the trendiest clubs in town being located in or around the ATT For Fun building. It’s beautiful, modern, clean, always vibrant, and not from from some good hikes around Elephant mountain. But if you’re hoping to end the month with some money in your bank account, maybe just save Xinyi for the weekend.</p>

        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">East District</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Blue</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>High</p>
            <p class="my-6">Located just next to the luxurious Xinyi is the slightly more affordable East District. The East District is mostly known for its shopping, where hundreds of little boutique stores fill in the gaps between some of the world’s biggest brands. There’s also a good variety of western food and bars as well as the availability of cheap local food. It’s a very busy area so be prepared to deal with crowded streets, but if you’re lucky enough to snag an apartment at an affordable price, it’s a great place for somebody who enjoys the social scene.</p>

        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">Da'an</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Red</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>Moderate/High</p>
            <p class="my-6">In the center of Da’an is one of Taipei’s biggest parks, known as Da’an Forest Park. It’s a spectacular park and and a fantastic place to be on a sunny day in the city. Lots of expats live in Da’an, and the park seems to set the tone for a calm, family oriented neighborhood. Yongkang Street is full of excellent restaurants (local and western) as well as boutique shops. Recommended for it’s good balance of life, location and number of fellow expats.</p>

        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">Gongguan</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Green</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>Moderate</p>
            <p class="my-6">Gongguan is a student hotspot thanks to the presence of the National Taiwan University. This brings with it all the benefits of a student area, such as cheap food options, lots of cafes and tea shops, and cheaper rent. There’s also a night market and easy access to the river park which has tennis courts, basketball courts and bike paths. Gongguan is home to a large amount of expats, both students and non-students, however, it can feel a bit far from the action at times.</p>

        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">Ximen</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Blue</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>Moderate</p>
            <p class="my-6">Ximen is only one stop away from Taipei Main Station. It’s most known for Ximending (pronounced: she-min-ding), which is a tightly packed shopping district where one can buy almost anything for almost nothing. The streets of Ximending are filled with young trendy kids, and in the spaces between the shops crowds often gather to watch musicians, magicians, dancers and other street performers. It’s also known for the Red Brick Theater as well as the cluster of bars just next to the Red Brick Theater that make up Taipei’s gay area. It’s a bustling little neighborhood so peace and quiet may be hard to come by, but it is very conveniently located with plenty of amenities such as restaurants, cinemas and shops.</p>

        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">Neihu</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Brown</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>High</p>
            <p class="my-6">Neihu is Taipei's Silicon Valley. It is mostly made up of multinational companies and luxury high rise buildings. Many of the foreigners who live in Neihu work for those international companies, although there are a few teaching jobs available. It’s a beautiful, clean neighborhood with high quality restaurants, the Miramar shopping mall and Ferris wheel, and access to the river park. Apartments will be modern yet very expensive, and often on weekends when the company buildings are empty it can seem a bit dead. It’s also quite far out for those who want to be part of the social scene and nightlife.</p>

        <div class="mt-12 text-xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl mt-16 mb-8 font-cursive">New Taipei City</h3>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">MRT Line: </span>Multiple</p>
            <p class=""><span class="font-cursive">Rent: </span>Cheap</p>
            <p class="my-6">New Taipei City is made up of all the districts that surround Taipei City on all sides. Geographically it is a massive area and even includes neighboring towns. So for the purpose of this Starter Pack we’ll be referring only to the neighborhoods that still connect to the MRT line, such as Tamsui on the red line, Luzhou, Sanchong and Zhonghe on the orange line, and Xindian on the green line.</p>
            <p class="my-6">
                The rent in New Taipei City is much cheaper, and bigger apartments are easier to come by. There are plenty of English teaching jobs to be found in New Taipei City, but fewer expats, bars, and western restaurants. Although these areas are only a short MRT ride away from the city, by Taipei standards they are considered far out.

                To give you some perspective, here’s how long it will take on the MRT according to the Explore Taipei APP.
