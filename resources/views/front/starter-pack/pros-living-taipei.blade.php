        <ul class="text-xl pl-0">
            <li class="my-6"><strong>More foreigners. </strong>
                The amount of foreigners living and working in Taipei far exceeds any other city. So you’re bound to meet some interesting individuals and ultimately find a crowd that shares similar interests with you.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>More jobs. </strong>
                There are thousands of English schools and ESL centers in Taipei, and the turnover of jobs is high. There may be some dry times mid-semester, but for most of the time you shouldn’t struggle to find a teaching job in Taipei.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>More English. </strong>
                If you’re moving to Taiwan without knowing a single word of Chinese then Taipei will probably be the most forgiving. Not to say that it will be a breeze, but perhaps more so than its southern counterparts.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Public transport. </strong>
                Public transport in Taipei is cheap, efficient and abundant. So much so that many locals and foreigners have no means of transport of their own.The MRT (subway) will get you in walking distance of pretty much anywhere. The busses are dirt cheap and exceptionally efficient. Taxis are abundant any time of day or night. Ubike stations are scattered throughout the city with clearly marked bike lanes in most places. It really couldn’t be easier.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Close to the airport. </strong>
                Taipei now has an MRT line that will take you straight to the terminal you need. So trips back home or sneaky vacations are just that much easier and cheaper.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Taipei Main Station. </strong>
                Taipei Main Station, located in the middle of the city, connects the MRT, the High Speed Rail, the regular train, the bus station and the subway line to airport. From here you can travel to pretty much anywhere in the country at varying speeds and costs.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Convenience. </strong>
                If you’re living in Taipei City (as opposed to New Taipei City, which is made up of all the outer suburbs and towns) you’ll more than likely have everything you need within a 5 minute radius of your house. Numerous 24 hour convenience stores where you can do everything from paying your bills to getting dinner to buying train tickets to grabbing a late night beer. You’ll also have a supermarket, restaurants, breakfast shops, coffee shops, a mechanic and at least three hair salons, if that’s your thing.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Nightlife. </strong>
                Taipei far outplays the other cities in the night life arena. From high end super clubs to dive bars, lounges, live shows, cafes, and night markets. You will be entertained any night of the week. Check out

            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Recreation. </strong>
                There’s also loads of stuff to keep you entertained in the day. Head to a nearby beach for a day in the sun, jump on a bike and enjoy the endless web of bike paths along the river, head into the mountains for a hike, join a sports league (rugby, soccer, darts and more) or keep an eye on the events that happen every weekend.
