        <p class="text-xl my-6">The three main cities of Taiwan are Taipei up north, Taichung in the center of the island, and Kaohsiung down south. And to be fair they all have their own charms and attractions. Taichung has the best weather, Kaohsiung is cheap and super laid back, but Taipei, being the capital, has way more to offer on everything from food to jobs to entertainment. For anybody moving to Taiwan for the first time, itâ€™s an excellent starting point. That being said, it would only be fair to break down the pros and cons of living in the capital.</p>
