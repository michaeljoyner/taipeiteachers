        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Whether you’re on your way or whether you’ve just arrived, welcome to The Beautiful Island. The land that thousands of expats are happy to call their second home.

            Why do they love it so much? You’ll have to ask them. Maybe it’s the bliss of living in one of the safest countries in the world. Maybe it’s the superior internet speed. Maybe it’s the kindness of locals towards foreigners or the efficiency of government agencies that are geared to make everything foreigner friendly. Maybe it’s the food.  Maybe it’s the fact that you can travel anywhere on the island at any time without ever owning a car, motorcycle or bicycle. Or maybe it’s because you can see a dentist for the price of three Oreo McFlurries.

            It’s probably all these things, and a whole lot more. But what we do know for sure is that you’re gonna have a great time, and if you thought you were just coming for one year, you should think again.

            But on a serious note. Taiwan will treat you well. Very well. Almost too well, some might say. So all we ask is that you be a good human and show a little bit of respect back. Local people can be shy when talking to foreigners, respect that. Drinking in public is legal, but keep your pants on. There might be days where you feel your job is too easy, but still respect your students and make sure you’re giving them the best class you can.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            You’re in for a wild, crazy, unforgettable adventure. Enjoy every moment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            All the best.
