        <ul class="pl-0 text-xl mt-6">
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">Apartments are measured in ping. </span>
                1 ping = 3.306 square meters. The Chinese character for ping is 坪.
            </li>
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">Landlords aren't great photographers. </span>
                Demand for apartments in Taipei is high enough for landlords to care very little for pretty pictures. The pictures on 591.com.tw are after very poor and often taken before the house is even cleaned.
            </li>
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">Apartments are not generally cleaned before you move in. </span>
                The turnaround time between tenants in Taipei is very quick. One moves out and the other moves in the next day. So the norm is that the apartment will probably be dirty when you get it, and it’s up to you to give it a good scrub or get a maid for a day to give it a once over.
            </li>
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">All in one bathrooms. </span>
                Unless it’s a pricey, modern apartment, the bathroom is likely to be an all-in-on affair. That means that there is nothing separating the shower from the basin and toilet and pretty much everything will be wet after a shower. But it’s kind of convenient at the same time. You’ll see.
            </li>
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">Kitchens aren't a given. </span>
                This might come as a shock for first timers. But because food is so readily available outside, and also because some apartments just don’t have the space, many apartments have a kitchen that is nothing more than a counter with a stovetop and a sink, while smaller single living apartments don’t have a kitchen at all. Bigger kitchens can be found, but usually only in two or three bedroom apartments.
            </li>
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">Check the trash situation. </span>
                Taiwan has a very unique way of disposing of trash. You need to take the trash down to the trash truck when it passes your house at a specified time. This can be tricky if you’re busy during those times. However, some apartments have a place downstairs where tenants can dump their trash anytime and it gets sorted out for them. An apartment that offers this service is worth a little extra rent.
            </li>
            <li class="my-8"><span class="font-bold">Rent can be negotiated. </span>
                If you think a place is just a little too pricey, it’s worth trying to negotiate. If you’re well mannered and nice enough they might just drop the rent just a little. It’s not a guarantee, but worth a try. Some landlords also offer cheaper rent if you pay three months at a time instead of monthly, and a much bigger discount if you can just pay the year’s rent in one lump sum.
