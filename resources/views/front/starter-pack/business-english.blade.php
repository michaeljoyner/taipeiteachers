        <p class="mt-6 text-xl mb-2"><span class="font-bold">$$$: </span>NT700 - 1000+/hr</p>
        <p class="text-xl mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Pros: </span>Good for networking and getting insight into the corporate side of Taiwan.</p>
        <p class="text-xl mb-16"><span class="font-bold">Cons: </span>Lots of travel time, getting a permanent position can be tough, varying needs and expectations can be hard to meet.</p>
        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">About the job.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            In the corporate world, there are a lot of companies who are willing to pay decent money to improve the English skills of their staff. Improved email writing, presentation skills, and client relations are extremely valuable to companies who deal with foreign clients, and a few prominent companies have capitalized on this demand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            As a teacher you could be required to do 1 on 1 coaching, group classes or in-house training where you travel to the client to train staff on their premises. With a full time position it will likely be a combination of all three, with your busiest times being 12-2pm (lunch break classes) and evenings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Compared to the other kinds of teaching jobs, these positions are few and far between.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            At the very least, you’ll need to have completed a degree in a business related field. But if you hope to get a full time time position you’ll need to have a few years of business experience under the belt.
        </p>

        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">What you should know.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Having clients in different parts of the city means more travel, however you will likely be compensated for any travel you do. But it also means you’re unlikely to have the convenience of block hours, and as clients come and go you may have to deal with a fluctuating schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Mostly you’ll have very engaged clients who want to gain as much insight as they can from you, but dealing with a group who all have different levels and needs can be tricky to manage.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            However, if you do get a full time position, the pay can be very good and positive feedback from clients will lead to more hours and ultimately a handsome salary. You’ll also be rubbing shoulders with people in the corporate world in Taiwan which could potentially lead to other opportunities.
        </p>
        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">How to get the job.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Business English jobs do occasionally show up on the various job board websites, but if you’re intent on working in this field it’s probably best to contact the companies directly. Get your resume up to date with an emphasis on your experience in business and your ability to communicate well with individuals and large groups. Contact the company and ask if there is a position open or if you can be placed on a waiting list.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            If you do get an interview, dress formally and be prepared to do a teaching demo for the manager and perhaps some other teachers to observe.
