        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">About the job.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">Teaching English in Kindergartens is actually illegal in Taiwan. It’s important to know that, and if you are caught you are likely to be deported. This law was put in place a few years ago to prevent kids from learning English before they establish a good foundation of Chinese. But that being said, there is still a kindergarten on most streets and it is common knowledge that many of them have a foreign teacher. The risk is up to you.</p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">Generally there are two kinds of jobs when it comes to kindergarten.</p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">The first (often known as whole-language kindergarten) is where you will be a full time home-room teacher and stay with the same class every day from morning to lunch, and then again for an hour or two after lunch. It can be very rewarding in the way that little kids learn languages very quickly and most of their progress will be thanks to you rather than a combination of teachers.</p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            There is also very little preparation as you just pick up each day from where you left off the day before, and once you have found a good stride with your class it can become a very pleasant job to have. You will have a Chinese teacher in the class to help you keep control, translate some things and just be a helping hand. She will also teach Chinese to your class in the afternoons so basically the two of you will work as a team.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            The job involves lots of singing and dancing, teaching numbers and letters, and most importantly teaching the students basic conversation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            The other kind of kindergarten job (often known as bilingual kindergarten) is where you will teach a few 30 minute classes each day. These classes have a Taiwanese teacher who teaches them in English and Chinese throughout the day except for the 30 minutes they have with you. So effectively you’re not in control of any particular class and therefore have less responsibility for their overall learning .
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            But on the down side, it is quite an energy intensive gig as you need to go into each class with the same amount of energy as the first, and that can be tiring. Also, generally speaking, students in these classes have a lower level of English as they only have one short class with a foreign teacher each day, so progress can be a bit slow.
        </p>
        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">What you should know.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">Being kindergarten, you’re gonna have to entertain and make the kids happy. So be ready to sing songs, dance and generally play the fool. There will also be tears (not yours) and moments of chaos, so you’ll need to figure out a way maintaining order in class. If you don’t take yourself too seriously and you’re looking to work mornings, this one’s for you.</p>
        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">How to get the job.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            If you interview for a kindergarten job they will most likely ask you to do a 20 minute demo with a class of kids. It’s best to ask them beforehand if you’ll need to do a demo so you can prepare for it. Make sure you ask them what age the kids will be and also what their level is so you can prepare accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            It’s best to choose a topic that the kids already know, that way they’re more likely to get involved. If you choose something too complicated it’ll just be a bunch of kids staring at you blankly, so pick something easy like colors, numbers, animals or types of weather. There are plenty of sites like <a href="https://www.eslgamesplus.com" class="text-site-primary">eslgamesplus.com</a> that offer free, printable flash cards, and sites like <a class="text-site-primary" href="http://genkienglish.net">genkienglish.net</a> that have a long list of games to play with students.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            For a 20 minute demo, spend some time introducing yourself and trying to get the kids to to tell you their names and open up to you a little bit. Then teach the topic you have prepared and use it to play a game with them. Make it a super easy game to explain and also one that won’t end in chaos (little kids get excited really easily). Then maybe end off with by teaching them a fun song.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Bosses will likely be unphased about what topic you teach, game you play or song you teach. They’ll be looking to see if you’re fun with kids, if you are able to get the kids speaking English (all the kids, so try include even the quiet ones) and whether you can control a class, so don’t be afraid to be firm with kids that get out of control.
