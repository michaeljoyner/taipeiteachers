        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">About the job.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Companies such as Tutor ABC and HiTutor, who offer affordable online English classes, have been growing rapidly in recent years. A lot of Taiwanese are too shy to actively seek out a private tutor, dont have the time to travel to classes, or are just attracted to the lower prices and professionalism of the companies, and therefore find online classes the perfect fit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            These classes are generally focused on improving conversation rather than actual teaching. Materials and guidelines for each class are laid out by the company, so all you need is good internet speed (a given in Taiwan), a reliable computer, a headset and fun, friendly personality.
        </p>
        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">What you should know.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            The hourly pay is pretty low compared to the other kinds of teaching jobs, so this kind of job is probably best paired with another part time teaching job.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            It’s also useful for those who are trying to invest their time in other things, such as studying Chinese or starting a business, and just need to make a few extra bucks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            While they say the hours are flexible they do use the word ‘flexible’ a bit loosely. There is generally a minimum amount of hours you can work and also working during peak hours is compulsory.
        </p>
        <h3 class="my-16 text-2xl font-bold">How to get the job.</h3>
        <p class="text-xl my-6">
            Each company website will have a section to apply for teaching positions. Just follow the prompts. Tutor ABC lists its requirements as the following:
