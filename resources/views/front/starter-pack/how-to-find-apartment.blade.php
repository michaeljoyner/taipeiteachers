        <p class="text-xl my-6">Until you find out which part of Taipei you want to live in, it’s best not to sign any sort of long term contract. You never know where you might end up finding a job, so keep it short term at first. If you’ve got a friend who’ll let you crash on the sofa for a week or two, that would be ideal. If not, here are some options.</p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6"><span class="font-bold">House share. </span>There are a lot of houses that are shared by expats and often looking for somebody to fill a room. This is a great option as there is no contract to sign and generally speaking the price for a room is quite low. Usually a month’s rent is required as the deposit. Check out the Facebook group Looking For Roommates Or Apartments In Taipei And Taiwan. It’s all in English and probably the best way to find your first place. Living with other expats when you’re new to Taiwan comes with a bunch of obvious advantages.</p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6"><span class="font-bold">Short term rent. </span>If you’re not up for sharing a house for the first few months then check out <a href="https://www.rentaltw.com" class="text-site-primary">rentaltw.com</a>. It’s an English based website that offers short term and long term rent options in all the various neighborhoods of the city, although their prices seem quite high.</p>
        <p class="text-xl my-6"><span class="font-bold">Long term rent. </span>The go-to site for finding an apartment in Taiwan is <a href="https://www.591.com.tw" class="text-site-primary">591.com</a>. But unless you can read and speak Chinese you’ll need some help using the site, calling landlords and signing contacts. Once you find a job your school will more than likely be willing to help you with this process.</p>
