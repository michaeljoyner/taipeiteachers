        <ul class="text-xl pl-0">
            <li class="my-6"><strong>It's expensive. </strong>
                Everything is slightly more expensive in Taipei when compared to the other cities. From restaurant prices, drinks in a bar, and certainly rent. But that’s not to say you can’t live cheaply in Taipei. Local food is still dirt cheap, there are cheaper alternatives for nightlife, and cheap accommodation is possible. You’ll just have to be disciplined.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Apartments are smaller and elevators are rare. </strong>
                Taipei is an old city, so many of the apartments were built without elevators (killer glutes coming your way ). Apartments are also generally very small. If you’re after a bigger apartment be ready to pay high prices. Alternatively you could join a house share or look for a place in New Taipei City. The price of a two bedroom apartment in New Taipei City is often the same as a shoebox apartment in Taipei City.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Not the best weather. </strong>
                For an island that’s only 394 km long, the weather in different cities can be vastly different at any given time. Unfortunately Taipei gets the short end of the stick. Taipei gets more rain and more cold weather than any of the other cities. Generally speaking, the further down the island you go, the better the weather gets.
            </li>
            <li class="my-6"><strong>Crowds. </strong>
                Taipei is a dense city. 2.7 million people live in Taipei and geographically speaking it’s not a very big city. So be prepared to deal with a lot of people, especially on weekends and during rush hour. But you’ll soon learn which areas get crowded at particular times and learn how to avoid those places.
