        Bare in mind that you’ll likely be doing a combination of these. For example, most teachers who teach kindergarten also teach in cram schools, while many who teach adult classes also do some private tutoring.

        The beauty of teaching ESL in Taiwan (and especially Taipei where jobs are plentiful) is that you can tailor your own schedule. If your goal is money alone, you can full all the hours of the day with classes (and die of exhaustion after one week!). On the other hand, you can make decent money teaching only a few hours a day, and use the rest of the day to work on personal projects, study Chinese, or just generally enjoy life. Each to his own!

        The minimum working requirement to get a Resident Visa is 14 hours a week with the same company.
